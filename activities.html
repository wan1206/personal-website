  <h1>My Activities</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: white;">Throughout my time at university, I have participated in various activities that have helped build my leadership and teamwork skills. Among them are:</p><br>
  <p style="color: white;">-Participating in university events such as fun runs, Solidarity Week, and others.</p><br>
  <p style="color: white;">-Serving as a media committee member for the OBS Beginner Crash Course programme organized by PSK Club members.</p><br>
  <p style="color: white;">-Involving myself in community service by helping the elderly at the Ketoyong senior care centre and assisting in sorting clothes to be donated to underprivileged families and flood victims.</p><br>
  <p style="color: white;">These activities have not only provided me with valuable experiences but have also taught me the importance of communication and collaboration.</p>
